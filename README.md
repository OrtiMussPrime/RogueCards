# RogueCards – Mobile-First Rogue-like Deckbuilding Dungeon Crawler
## Overview
RogueCards is a cross-platform, mobile-first game developed in Unity, blending the thrill of rogue-like dungeon exploration with strategic deckbuilding mechanics. Players traverse procedurally generated dungeons by playing cards to create pathways, engage in dice-based combat, and unlock permanent meta-upgrades. Designed primarily for mobile (iOS/Android) with a seamless PC adaptation, RogueCards offers a rich, engaging experience that’s both accessible and deep.

## Features
Dynamic Dungeon Generation:
Procedurally generated grid-based dungeons that start at 3×3 and expand as the player progresses. Each dungeon features unique themes—ruins, ice dungeons, volcanoes, and dark temples—with environmental modifiers that affect gameplay.

## Diverse Card System:
A robust card mechanic including:

- Path Cards: Create movement routes.
- Combat Cards: Weapons, buffs, debuffs, and consumables.
- Special Effect Cards: Trigger abilities such as teleportation, stasis, and invisibility.
- Dice-Based Combat:
Tactical combat where battles are resolved via dice rolls combined with card-based modifiers, delivering strategic depth reminiscent of classic RPG systems.

## Meta-Progression:
Rewarding players with permanent upgrades—new cards, in-game currency, and skill tree enhancements—after each dungeon run, ensuring continuous progression and replayability.

## Robust Monetization:
